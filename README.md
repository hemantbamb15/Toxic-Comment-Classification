# Toxic-Comment-Classification

Toxic Comment Classification is a crucial task in natural language processing aimed at identifying and filtering out harmful or offensive content in text. This task involves training models to recognize various forms of toxicity, including hate speech, harassment, and abusive language. By analyzing and classifying comments based on their toxicity, these models help maintain safer and more respectful online environments. Techniques such as text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization using methods like TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec are employed to preprocess the data, while machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and linear SVM are used to build predictive models. Balancing the dataset with SMOTE and evaluating model performance through metrics like accuracy and ROC AUC are also key aspects of this process.

Implementing toxic comment classification not only aids in moderating user-generated content but also contributes to enhancing user experience on platforms by reducing exposure to harmful interactions. Advanced models and algorithms are continuously being developed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of toxicity detection. For example, leveraging deep learning techniques and pre-trained models can capture nuanced patterns in text that traditional methods might miss. As these systems evolve, they play a significant role in promoting a more inclusive and positive online community, aligning with broader efforts to combat cyberbullying and online abuse.
